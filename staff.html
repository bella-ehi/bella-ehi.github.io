          <h2>Isabella E.</h2>
          <p><strong>Founder | HerRenaissance by I.E. Foundation</strong></p>
<p>
I’m an IGCSE All-Star and recent A-level graduate in Maths, Physics, and Chemistry, with distinctions across board exams like WAEC and Cambridge. I'm passionate about computer science, art, and aerospace engineering, and how they can be used to solve real-world problems.
  </p>
<p>
  I’m also a self-taught, nationally award-winning artist. I earned first place nationally in my category at a prestigious art competition hosted by the Nigerian Conservation Foundation (NCF). Art has always been one of the ways I express ideas, advocate for change, and inspire others to dream boldly.
</p>
  <p> As a proud Edo girl from Nigeria, I created this foundation to uplift underprivileged women and girls. I know what it’s like to face societal barriers, but I also know how powerful education, tech, and community can be in breaking them down. I’ve taught STEM subjects, created art, built games, and organized donation drives, all driven by one belief: that every girl deserves the tools to rewrite her story.</p>
<p>
   I’ve also worked with Nigerian companies and earned money through multiple small businesses, from making bracelets, cookies, and cakes, to offering branding services for small startup companies, showing my strong entrepreneurial spirit.
</p>
   <p> HerRenaissance is my love letter to every Nigerian girl and every other girl out there who has ever been told she’s not enough. Through this foundation, I combine my technical talents, artistic flair, and leadership skills to provide mentorship, resources, and sisterhood to girls ready to rise.</p>
